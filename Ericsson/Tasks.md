1. Make error fix 
2. look up table instead of having big String name
3. what is DPDK?
4. add constant line to XY graph
5.         
```
Collection<ITmfTrace> traces = TmfTraceManager.getTraceSet(trace);
```
insted ot this just get all UST traces!

6. I asked for y title in graph using counter and Matheiw told me work with Patric for finding these kind of issues
8. He asked for a youtube videos that use counter for xy graph and spark is a useCase

10. some of varibale ib string. change to Inegeter

11.         
traceevent racessces counteraspectanaysis 


```
org.eclipse.tracecompass.incubator.traceevent.core > src > org.eclipse.tracecompass.incubator.internal.traceevent.core.analysis.counter > TraceEventCounterAnalysis.java
```







--------------------------------------
solved: 
9. in DailyScrum there is somthing to sign. then I can share code in Github 
11. write a bash code to find all root file

12. Fix this one: 
```
The error message indicates that the class org.eclipse.tracecompass.incubator.spark_test1.ui.AnalysisModule1 cannot 
be found by the bundle org.eclipse.tracecompass.incubator.spark_test1.ui_0.1.0.qualifier.
 This issue is typically caused by one of the following problems:
```
13.
```diff
+ tiny patch for Trace compass: CTF verificaiton
+ git add -> git commit -> git push 
```

10. Add a function in Spark trace -> use lambda for making the Aspect
