Here’s the scenario with the full names included:

### Simple 5G Scenario: Streaming a Video

1. **Connecting to the Network:**
   - You open a video streaming app on your 5G smartphone. The phone connects to the nearest 5G base station (Radio Access Network, or **RAN**).

2. **Authentication and Mobility:**
   - The Access and Mobility Management Function (**AMF**) authenticates your device, confirming that you’re allowed to access the network. If you move, AMF ensures you stay connected as you switch between cells.

3. **Session Management:**
   - The Session Management Function (**SMF**) sets up a data session, assigning you an IP address and managing the data flow between your device and the streaming server.

4. **Data Transfer:**
   - The User Plane Function (**UPF**) handles routing the video data from the server to your device, ensuring fast and smooth playback.

5. **Security:**
   - The Authentication Server Function (**AUSF**) ensures that the communication between your device and the network remains secure, using encryption and authentication keys.

6. **Optimized Routing:**
   - The Service Communication Proxy (**SCP**) ensures that data is routed efficiently, avoiding congestion and maintaining video quality.

This entire process happens seamlessly in the background, providing you with a fast, reliable, and secure video streaming experience on a 5G network.
