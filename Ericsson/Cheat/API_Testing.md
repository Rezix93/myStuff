Here is an expanded list with additional descriptions for each type of software testing:

1. **Unit Testing:** Tests individual components or functions to ensure they work as intended. It is typically automated and focuses on the smallest parts of an application.

2. **Integration Testing:** Tests interactions between integrated components to verify they work together. It helps catch issues in the interaction between different modules.

3. **Functional Testing:** Verifies specific functionalities against requirements. This type of testing checks if the software does what it is supposed to do.

4. **System Testing:** End-to-end testing of the complete application in an environment that mimics production. It validates the integrated systemâ€™s compliance with specified requirements.

5. **Acceptance Testing:** Validates the system against user requirements and business needs. It is often the final step before delivering the software to the customer.

6. **Performance Testing:** Assesses speed, scalability, and stability of the system under various conditions. It ensures the software meets performance criteria.

7. **Load Testing:** Checks system behavior under expected load to ensure stability. It involves simulating multiple users accessing the application simultaneously.

8. **Stress Testing:** Tests the system beyond normal capacity to find its breaking point. This helps in understanding how the system behaves under extreme conditions.

9. **Security Testing:** Identifies vulnerabilities and ensures data protection against breaches. It involves testing for potential threats like SQL injection, XSS, etc.

10. **Smoke Testing:** Basic tests to check the initial stability of a new build. It ensures that the major functions work properly before more in-depth testing begins.
