The terms **Continuous Integration (CI)** and **Continuous Deployment (CD)** describe the ongoing, automated processes in software development:

- **Continuous Integration (CI):** "Continuous" refers to the frequent and automated merging of code changes into a shared repository. This integration occurs multiple times daily, ensuring that new code works with the existing codebase.

- **Continuous Deployment (CD):** "Continuous" reflects the automatic, ongoing process of deploying validated code changes to production without manual intervention. This ensures that new features and fixes are delivered to users frequently and reliably.

## Continuous Integration (CI)

### Benefits of CI:
1. **Early Bug Detection:** Automated testing catches bugs early when they are easier and cheaper to fix.
2. **Improved Collaboration:** Frequent commits encourage collaboration, as developers integrate their work frequently, reducing merge conflicts.
3. **Faster Development:** Continuous integration means faster development cycles, enabling teams to deliver features more rapidly.
4. **Higher Quality Code:** Automated tests ensure that only code that meets quality standards is integrated, maintaining a stable codebase.
   
### CI Tools:
- **Jenkins:** Popular open-source CI tool with a wide range of plugins.
- **GitLab CI/CD:** Integrated with GitLab repositories, offering a simple setup.
- **CircleCI, Travis CI, Bamboo:** Other popular CI tools that support various languages and integrations.

### Workflow:
1. **Code Commit:** Developers push code changes to a version control system (e.g., Git).
2. **Build Triggered:** A CI server detects changes and triggers an automated build process.
3. **Automated Tests:** A suite of tests runs to verify code functionality and performance.
4. **Feedback:** Developers receive immediate feedback, allowing them to address any issues promptly.
