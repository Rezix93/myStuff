**Design patterns** are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Hereâ€™s a more detailed look into the main types:

### 1. **Creational Patterns:**
   - Focus on the creation of objects in a way that suits the situation.
   - **Examples:** 
     - **Singleton:** Ensures a class has only one instance.
     - **Factory Method:** Creates objects without specifying the exact class.
     - **Builder:** Constructs complex objects step-by-step.

### 2. **Structural Patterns:**
   - Concerned with how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Adapter:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
     - **Decorator:** Adds behavior to objects dynamically.
     - **Facade:** Simplifies a complex system with a single interface.

### 3. **Behavioral Patterns:**
   - Focus on communication and responsibility between objects.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Observer:** Notifies multiple objects when one object changes state.
     - **Strategy:** Allows selecting an algorithm at runtime.
     - **Command:** Encapsulates a request as an object.

Design patterns help improve code reusability, readability, and maintainability.
