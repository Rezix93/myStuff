**Docker** is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications inside lightweight, portable containers. Containers package an application with all its dependencies, ensuring it runs consistently across different environments (e.g., development, testing, production). Docker simplifies the process of managing and deploying applications, making it easier to scale, isolate, and maintain software.

Key features:
- **Consistency:** Same environment across development and production.
- **Isolation:** Containers run independently, avoiding conflicts.
- **Scalability:** Easy to scale applications up or down. 


**Docker Components** include:

1. **Docker Client:** CLI or GUI that interacts with the Docker Daemon to manage containers.
2. **Docker Daemon:** Background service running on the host that builds, runs, and manages containers.
5. **Docker Registry:** Stores Docker images (e.g., Docker Hub, private registries).

These components work together to provide a robust containerization platform.
