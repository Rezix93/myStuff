**Jenkins** is a simple, open-source tool for automating software development. It helps developers:
   
- **Build:** Compile code automatically.
- **Test:** Run tests to catch bugs early.
- **Deploy:** Release new versions of apps.

### Key Points:
- **Plugins:** Over 1,500 plugins to integrate with tools you use.
- **Pipelines:** Create steps (pipelines) for building, testing, and deploying code.
- **Distributed Builds:** Run tasks on multiple machines for faster results.

Jenkins is widely used for its flexibility and strong community support, making it a top choice in DevOps.

In Jenkins, the types of agents (nodes) you can configure include:

1. **Permanent Agent:** A manually configured agent that is always available for jobs.
2. **Cloud Agents (Ephemeral):** Created on-demand, often in cloud environments like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.
3. **Docker Agent:** Runs jobs inside Docker containers for isolation.
4. **Kubernetes Agent:** Uses Kubernetes pods as ephemeral agents to run jobs in a Kubernetes cluster.
5. **SSH Agent:** Connects to a remote machine via SSH for job execution.
6. **Windows Agent:** Uses Windows Remote Management (WinRM) or Java Web Start.
7. **JNLP Agent:** Connects using Java Network Launch Protocol, suitable for various environments.

These agents provide flexibility to run Jenkins jobs in different environments and scales, depending on your infrastructure needs.
