An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that developers can use to communicate with a service, enabling them to build software applications. 

APIs can be used for various purposes, such as accessing data, integrating different systems, or executing functions in a remote server. Common types of APIs include **REST**, **SOAP**, and **GraphQL**, each offering different ways of handling requests and responses.


**Microservices** is an architectural style where an application is built as a collection of small, loosely coupled services. Each service is focused on a specific business capability, independently developed, deployed, and scaled. Microservices communicate via APIs and can use different technologies, databases, and programming languages.

### When to Use Microservices:
- **Complex Projects:** When building a large, complex application with multiple business domains.
- **Scalability Needs:** When parts of an application need to scale independently.
- **Continuous Deployment:** When you want to enable frequent, isolated deployments without affecting the entire system.
- **Team Autonomy:** When teams need the freedom to work independently on different parts of the application.

Microservices are ideal for large, evolving applications where scalability, flexibility, and rapid development are critical. However, they introduce complexity in deployment, testing, and inter-service communication, so they are not always the right choice for simpler projects.
