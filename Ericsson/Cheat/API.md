An **API (Application Programming Interface)** is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data formats that developers can use to communicate with a service, enabling them to build software applications. 

APIs can be used for various purposes, such as accessing data, integrating different systems, or executing functions in a remote server. Common types of APIs include **REST**, **SOAP**, and **GraphQL**, each offering different ways of handling requests and responses.
