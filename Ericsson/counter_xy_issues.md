1.  Trace Compass counter module is displaying non-integer values (like 0.5), which isn’t necessary since you're only dealing with integers. 
You could try addressing this by adjusting the settings or configurations for the graph to ensure that only integer values are displayed.

### Graph Configuration

1. **Graph Title**: A descriptive title that reflects the purpose of the graph.

2. **X-Axis Title**: Label describing what the X-axis represents (e.g., "Time (s)").

3. **Y-Axis Title**: Label describing what the Y-axis represents (e.g., "Counter Value").

4. **Axis Scales**:
   - **X-Axis Scale**: Choose between linear, logarithmic, or other scales depending on your data.
   - **Y-Axis Scale**: Select a suitable scale (linear, logarithmic, etc.).

5. **Y-Axis Range**: Set the minimum and maximum values for the Y-axis. For integer values, ensure that the scale uses integer intervals.

6. **Tick Intervals**:
   - **X-Axis Ticks**: Define how frequently ticks are displayed on the X-axis.
   - **Y-Axis Ticks**: Set tick intervals to ensure no fractional values (e.g., 1, 2, 3…).

This configuration will help you set up the core elements of your XY graph effectively.
